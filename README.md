## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

### ✅ Encapsulation
All book data is encapsulated inside the `BookDetail` class using private variables and public getters/setters.

### ✅ Inheritance
Shared methods are inherited where applicable for modularity and reusability.

### ✅ Abstraction
Different functionalities like adding, removing, or updating books are split into separate classes.
